# Website_Projects

This repository was initially created as a fun project to learn new skills and deepen existing ones during my free time, but it evolved into something beyond my expectations.

**#RafalStrona**
The first folder contains files for my very first website. I developed it for a friend who works in construction and runs a sole proprietorship.
The tech stack used includes **HTML**, **CSS** (**SCSS**), and **JavaScript**. The entire code was written in **Visual Studio Code**.

I utilized **GIT** for version control and **Jenkins** for continuous integration and future development. 
This project was entirely conceived by me, and I handled both the website's design and technical aspects from inception to completion.

Building this website required numerous hours spent on YouTube tutorials, StackOverflow, and various technical documentations.
**Currently the site is waiting for final updates and then will be deployed.**
**To display the effects open the file Strona_Glowna.html in Visual Studio Code and run it with Live Server.**

In the near future, I'm planning to start a new project for another friend of mine...
