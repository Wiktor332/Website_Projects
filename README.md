# Website_Projects

This repository was initially created as a fun project to learn new skills and deepen existing ones during my free time, but it evolved into something beyond my expectations.

The first folder contains files for my very first website. I developed it for a friend who works in construction and runs a sole proprietorship.
The tech stack used includes **HTML**, **CSS** (**SCSS**), and **JavaScript**. The entire code was written in **Visual Studio Code**.

I utilized **GIT** for version control and **Jenkins** for continuous integration and future development. 
This project was entirely conceived by me, and I handled both the website's design and technical aspects from inception to completion.

**Percentage distribution of languages: **

Building this website required numerous hours spent on YouTube tutorials, StackOverflow, and various technical documentations.

In the near future, I'm planning to start a new project for another friend of mine...
